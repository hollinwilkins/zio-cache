/**
 * A `Priority` is used to determine which values that may potentially be
 * retained in the cache should be retained if there is not sufficient space
 * in the cache for all values that could potentially be retained. Unlike
 * `Evict`, which describes a binary distinction between values that must be
 * evicted from the cache and values that may potentially be retained,
 * `Priority` describes a relative ordering of values that may potentially be
 * retained.
 *
 * You can think of `Priority` as like an `Ordering` except that the relative
 * priority of two entries in the cache may depend on the current time as well
 * as the two entries.
